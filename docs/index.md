## What Is Toolkit?

Toolkit is a collection of scripts, Python classes, assembler routines and build rules for developing programs for 8- and 16-bit computers. 

It is designed to be used with [Accelerate](https://accelerate.tpau.group) and [fast-ninja](https://fast-ninja.tpau.group).

## Why Use Toolkit?

Toolkit was primarily developed for use in our own programs.

While the scripts creating assembly code, the provided assembler routines, and the build rules are specific to Accelerate and fast-ninja, some scripts and the underlying Python classes are more versatile.

## Getting Started

Include Toolkit as a submodule in your Git repository:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/T-Pau/Toolkit Toolkit
```
